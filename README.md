# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-WEKA
The aim of the project is to find the intrusions happening in the system.
Initially KDDCup 1999 dataset was taken.
Preprocessed using Python(Zupyter Notebook).
The .csv file obtained from Zupyter notebook output is converted into .arff file in weka tool.
Using idsfinal.arff all the attributes in the dataset can be compared against intrusion variable.
All the machine Learning algorithms can be compared and their accuracy in finding the intrusions in the network can be noted.
