# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-WEKA
The aim of the project is to find the intrusions happening in the system.
Initially KDDCup 1999 dataset was taken.
Preprocessed using Python(Zupyter Notebook).
The .csv file obtained from Zupyter notebook output is converted into .arff file in weka tool.
Using idsfinal.arff all the attributes in the dataset can be compared against intrusion variable.
All the machine Learning algorithms can be compared and their accuracy in finding the intrusions in the network can be noted.
The outputs for both 60-40 and 80-20 split of training dataset and testing datsets for RandomForest , Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes classifiers is mentioned in .PNG files.
